-There are 1,549 eligible mentors. Making the possible new hires:mentor ratio 4.7:1

-The percentage of mentors in the Senior Engineers and Senior staff however, only make up 46.5% of all eligible menotrs.

## Summary

In Summation,

-  As the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact 72,458 roles willl need to be filled/replaced.
-  Assuming everyone eligible to participate in the mentorship program will volunteer thier efforts, there will still be a new hire:mentor ratio at about 5:1. This may prove to    be too much for mentors to handle.  Especially in the fields of Senior engiineers and Senior staff where you have a larger ratio of retirees:mentors
